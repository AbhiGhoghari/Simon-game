Simon Game
The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to remember and reproduce a random sequence of lights and sounds. It tests and improves a player's memory and concentration skills.

How to Play
The game consists of four colored buttons: green, red, blue, and yellow.

The game will randomly highlight one button, producing a sound associated with that button.

The player must remember the sequence and click the highlighted button.

After successfully clicking the correct button, the game will add another random button to the sequence, making it longer.

The player must replicate the entire sequence, including the new button, by clicking the buttons in the correct order.

If the player successfully reproduces the sequence, the game continues with an even longer sequence.

If the player makes a mistake and clicks the wrong button, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed.

The player can choose to play again to beat their high score or challenge themselves to remember longer sequences.
